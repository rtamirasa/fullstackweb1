# FullStackWeb

FullStackWeb is a fully responsive full-stack web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). This project includes features such as user authentication, like functionality, and dark mode, making it a comprehensive example of modern web development practices.

## About the Project

### Key Features
- **User Authentication**: Implemented using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure login and registration.
- **Like Functionality**: Users can like posts, with the likes dynamically updated and stored in the database.
- **Dark Mode**: A toggleable dark mode is available, providing a better user experience for those who prefer a dark theme.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is fully responsive, ensuring it looks great on devices of all sizes.

### Technologies Used
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used to store user information, posts, and other data.
- **Express**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, providing the foundation for the front-end of the application.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, used for the back-end of the application.
- **Material-UI (MUI)**: A popular React UI framework used to design the user interface with components that adhere to Google's Material Design guidelines.

### Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

- **`/client`**: Contains the front-end code, built with React. This includes components, hooks, and styles.
- **`/server`**: Contains the back-end code, including Express routes, controllers, and models.
- **`/config`**: Contains configuration files for the application, including the database connection.
- **`/public`**: Contains static assets like images and fonts.

### Challenges and Learnings
Throughout the development of this project, I faced challenges such as integrating dark mode effectively across the application and implementing secure authentication with JWT. These challenges allowed me to deepen my understanding of React state management, back-end security practices, and responsive design principles.
